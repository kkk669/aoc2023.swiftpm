Daily programming puzzles at [Advent of Code](<https://adventofcode.com/>), by
[Eric Wastl](<http://was.tl/>). This is a small example starter project for
building Advent of Code solutions.

## Usage

Swift comes with Swift Playgrounds. 

If you're using Swift Playgrounds, you can open this project by choosing "..." / Browse and
select the parent directory (`aoc2023.swiftpm`). 

## Challenges

The challenges assume three files (replace 00 with the day of the challenge).

- `Data/Day00.txt`: the input data provided for the challenge
- `Day00.swift`: the code to solve the challenge and any unit tests

To start a new day's challenge, make a copy of these files and update as
necessary. The `AdventOfCode.swift` file controls which day's challenge is run.
